        <div>
            <h3><u>Neuroplasticity</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to its environment and change with experience<br>
                <br>
                Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial because understanding that intelligence and learning ability is not static, is enough to improve learning abilities.<br>
                One study showed that children who held an understanding that intelligence is malleable received higher grades in mathematics than children, who didn’t. <br>
                <br>
                I plan to use the principals of neuroplasticity to aid my learning by reminding myself that intelligence is not innate, & that through practice, I can develop the knowledge and skills required for web development.

                For an interesting read, you might like to read about the brains of monks that were scanned while researching the effects of meditation on brain function <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080202012044/http://psyphz.psych.wisc.edu/web/News/Meditation_Alters_Brain_WSJ_11-04.htm">here</a>

            <h3><u>Growth Mindset</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Growth Mindset is the belief that talents can be developed as opposed to a fixed mindset which is the belief that talents are innate gifts.<br>
                <br>
                On my learning journey I plan to integrate growth mindset by not viewing a lack of understanding as a failure, but a growth opportunity.<br>
                I will try to focus on the learning opportunities in tasks rather than focusing on getting the task completed.
                <br><br>
                If you’d like more of an understanding of what a growth mindset is you can watch a video on it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU">here</a>
