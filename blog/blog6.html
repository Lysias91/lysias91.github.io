                Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to its environment and change with experience
                <br><br>
                Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is beneficial because understanding that intelligence and learning ability is not static, is enough to improve learning abilities.<br>
                One study showed that children who held an understanding that intelligence is malleable received higher grades in mathematics than children, who didn’t.
