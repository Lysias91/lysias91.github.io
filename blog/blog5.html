        <h1><u>Javascript Fundamentals</u></h1>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Differences between HTML and CSS</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                HTML elements are the ‘building blocks’ of a page.<br>
                HTML provides the basic text, links to images etc, but has very limited ability to add any style to the page.<br>
                CSS however is responsible for the presentation of the page.<br>
                Among other things, CSS dictates the layout of elements on a page, it can add colour to object and text on a page.<br><br>
                HTML is similar to a canvas maker, who provides the painter with something to work on. The painter would be CSS, adding style to the canvas.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Control flow and loops</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Control flow is the order in which code is executed, which is normally from top to bottom.<br>
                Loops can change this structure, as they ‘loop’ back to an earlier part of the flow (possibly a number of times) before allowing the remainder of the code to be executed.<br><br>
                This would be similar to somebody washing some plates. They would normally start with the first plate & continue washing them one-by-one until all plates were clean.<br>
                If there was a particularly dirty plate or plates that needed to be rewashed (once or multiple times), they would be required to ‘loop back’ to an earlier point in their flow I.e. rewashing previous plate(s). 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>The DOM</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The DOM is the Document Object Model which defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.<br>
                The structure is often represented as a tree as shown here:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img class="smallerImage" src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/dom-tree-model.png" alt="Picture showing the DOM tree model">
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The DOM is often displayed in this tree model because it is a good way of showing the relationship between items on a page.<br>
                In the image above, the HTML is the parent of both the ‘Head’ and ‘Body’ (children) items.<br>
                The ‘Head’ in turn is the parent of both the ‘Title’ and ‘Meta’ elements. Each child item has 1 parent item.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Accessing data from arrays and objects</u></h3>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h4><u>Arrays</u></h4>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Data stored in arrays is stored in a side-by-side, list-like format e.g:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/example-of-array.png" alt="example of an array">
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Each piece of data in the array has a corresponding ‘index position’.<br>
                The index position increases from left to right and is zero based, meaning we start counting from zero instead of 1 as shown here:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/example-of-index-positioning.png" alt="example of index positioning">
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                To access a piece of data, we find it’s corresponding index position & access it like so:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/accessing-array.png" alt="example of accessing array using bracket notation">
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h4><u>Objects</u></h4>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p>
                Data in objects is stored as shown in the picture below & can be accessed using <u>dot notation</u> or by using <U>bracket notation</U>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/example-of-an-object.png" alt="example of an object">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5><u>Dot Notation</u></h5>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                To access data in an object using dot notation, we place a ‘dot’ between the object name and the property as shown here:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img src="https://phill-mutu.github.io/blog/images/blog5/accessing-object-dot-notation.png" alt="example of accessing an object using dot notation">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5><u>Bracket Notation</u></h5>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                To access data in an object using bracket notation, we place the object name before a set of square brackets containing the propery associtated with the piece of data we are trying to access.<br>
                You can see an example of this here:
            </p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Functions</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                In Javascript, functions are defined with the ‘function’ keyword, which is followed by the name of the function, followed by closed brackets ( ).<br>
                Once defined, functions can be executed or 'called' using the name followed by ( ), which is followed by a set of curly braces { }, containing the code that is to be run when the function is called.
                <br><br>
                Functions are useful because they contain lines of code to be run. Instead of having to type out each line of code, each time we want the set of codes to run, we can call the function which will execute the set in order.
            </p>
        </div>
