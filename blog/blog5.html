        <h1><u>Javascript Fundamentals</u></h1>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Differences between HTML and CSS</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
        <p>
            HTML elements are the ‘building blocks’ of a page.<br>
            HTML provides the basic text, links to images etc, but has very limited ability to add any style to the page.<br>
            CSS however is responsible for the presentation of the page.<br>
            Among other things, CSS dictates the layout of elements on a page, it can add colour to object and text on a page.<br><br>
            HTML is similar to a canvas maker, who provides the painter with something to work on. The painter would be CSS, adding style to the canvas.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Control flow and loops</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Control flow is the order in which code is executed, which is normally from top to bottom.<br>
                Loops can change this structure, as they ‘loop’ back to an earlier part of the flow (possibly a number of times) before allowing the remainder of the code to be executed.<br><br>
                This would be similar to somebody washing some plates. They would normally start with the first plate & continue washing them one-by-one until all plates were clean.<br>
                If there was a particularly dirty plate or plates that needed to be rewashed (once or multiple times), they would be required to ‘loop back’ to an earlier point in their flow I.e. rewashing previous plate(s). 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><u>The DOM</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                The DOM is the Document Object Model which defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.<br>
                The structure is often represented as a tree as shown here:
