        <p>
            HTML elements are the ‘building blocks’ of a page.<br>
            HTML provides the basic text, links to images etc, but has very limited ability to add any style to the page.<br>
            CSS however is responsible for the presentation of the page.<br>
            Among other things, CSS dictates the layout of elements on a page, it can add colour to object and text on a page.<br><br>
            HTML is similar to a canvas maker, who provides the painter with something to work on. The painter would be CSS, adding style to the canvas.
