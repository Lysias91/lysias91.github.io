        <h1><u>Core Learnings</u></h1>
        
        <div>
            <h3><u>Personal Learnings From Core</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                I realised the importance of learning with others & discussing difficulties in learning with peers.<br>
                I found talking over insecurities and worries about the course work to be very reassuring.<br>
                I also realised that a lot of my thinking was that of a fixed mindset & that my lack of a comprehensive understanding of neuroplasticity was leading to thoughts and beliefs about myself and my abilities that were unnecessarily critical.  
            </div>

                <h3><u>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in Learning and Programming</u></h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                I think being empathetic towards yourself while you are learning something new is important, especially when learning something complicated like programming.<br> 
                Being empathetic & patient towards yourself lessens unnecessary stress felt while your brain adapts and becomes accustomed to a new way of thinking.<br> 
                I think it is important to be self aware of your own feelings and frustrations and where they are stemming from as they may stem from ideas that do not align with the principals of neuroplasticity and/or are based in a fixed-mindset.

            <h3><u>Surprises During Core Learning</u></h3>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>
                I was surprised to learn what a diverse group of people were in my cohort.<br>
                I also hadn’t learned about neuroplasticity before & was surprised to realise how much learning about it made me more confident in my ability to learn new concepts and ways of thinking.

        <div>
            <h3><u>Challenging Aspects of Core Learning</u></h3>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>
                I found it quite challenging asking for help using the slack channel as it was a very public forum & I had insecurities that my questions were ones I should have been able to answer myself, so I feared judgement from other foundationers.

            <h3><u>Importance of Core Learning in a Bootcamp</u></h3>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>
                I believe culture is an important part of a workplace environment.<br>
                I think that an individual’s ability to mesh well with other potential colleagues and improve the culture of the workplace, raises the likelihood of their employment with a prospective employer.<br>
                I think the learnings promotes in Core are helpful for recognising and improving skills & attributes that are condusive to a healthy workplace enviroment.

        <div>
            <h3><u>Is Core a 'Waste of Time'?</u></h3>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <p>
                While it’s not normally the type of learning that I typically enjoy or feel is much beyond common sense, I found the core material to be generally interesting, it gave me an insight into the types of people I will be working along side in bootcamp & It gave us interesting content to submit to our blogs.<br>
                I also found the listening & looping very beneficial as it introduced me to 2 of my cohort members who I have talked to about my struggles during foundations & have had my fears/worries validated in hearing them express similar thoughts.
