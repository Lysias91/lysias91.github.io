        <div>
            <p>
                I was blocked on the FizzBuzz exercise for a while.<br>
                I was feeling overwhelmed by the task and was unsure of where to start.<br>
                I found pseudocoding very helpful as it forced me to break the task up into smaller, more manageable tasks.<br>
                It also ensured that I was clear on what steps I needed to take to reach my goal.<br>
                Although I felt a level of stress and  a lack of confidence the whole time, I found that being able to complete the smaller tasks made me feel better about my abilities.<br>
                I feel that this was a good learning experience & that I will continue practicing pseudocoding when faced with complicated code.<br>
                <br>
                While I struggled a lot in the earlier JavaScript Kata, I feel I did okay in the JavaScript olympics.<br>
                By this point I had had a better understanding of the functions & objects I would need to use.<br>
                I also had a better understanding of some of the problem solving techniques recommended.<br>
                During the olympics task I managed to employ the rubber ducky method, console.logging, googling, pseudocode, & trying something.<br>
                During the ‘Jumble your words’ section of the Olympics, I found an elegant solution on MDN which allowed me to perform 3 methods at once:<br>
                const strReverse = str.split(‘').reverse().join('')<br>
                This was a good opportunity for me to learn the importance of using online resources for solutions.

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>Trying something</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                <li>Reading error messages</li>
                <li>Console.logging</li>
                <li>Googling</li>
                <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <p>
                I generally feel comfortable using any of the above techniques or processes.<br>
                I would say that I am less confident reading error messages because they can sometimes be hard to understand.<br>
                I also sometimes find it hard to ask peers through slack, as there are a lot of people in the foundations group which creates a lot of pressure.
