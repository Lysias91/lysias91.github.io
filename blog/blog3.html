            <p>
                I highly value kindness and compassion.<br>
                When I asked 3 of my friends what they would say my core values are, 2 said compassion and one said kindness.<br>
                I don’t think that I am always the kindest version of myself, which, as something I value, is something I am always trying to work more on.<br>
                I believe that it can take a lot of courage to be kind, especially when it means being vulnerable.<br>
