        <h1><u>My Identity, Values & Strengths</u></h1>

        <div>
            <h3><u>Values</u></h3>
            <p>
                I highly value kindness and compassion.<br>
                I don’t think that I am always the kindest version of myself, which, as something I value, is something I am always trying to work more on.<br>
                I believe that it can take a lot of courage to be kind, especially when it means being vulnerable.<br>
                <br>
                <em>“When the suffering of another creature causes you to feel pain, do not submit to the initial desire to flee from the suffering one, but on the contrary, come closer, as close as you can to him who suffers, and try to help him.”</em> – Leo Tolstoy
            </p>

            <h3><u>Culture and Identity</u></h3>
            <p>
                Growing up with surrounded by Maori culture, I have developed a strong sense of whanaungatanga and Manaakitanga. Nobody in my family lives in Wellington, but the chosen family I have found here are very close and supportive, and I know I can rely on them like family. 
            </p>

            <h3><u>Strengths and Limitations</u></h3>
            <p>
                I think my strengths would lie in my ability to navigate emotionally charged situations/conversations, I am good at engaging in smaller sized groups or one-on-one, but can be uncomfortable speaking out in larger groups.<br>
                I think ability working collaboratively in smaller groups, supporting others on tasks and remaining calm when things get stressful will be the best way to overcome obstacles. I think this plays to my strengths.
