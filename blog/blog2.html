            <h3>Long term goals and career pathway</h3>
            <p>I hope to obtain a job in the tech industry. I am not sure specifically what that looks like right now & am happy to keep my options open for the time being</p>

            <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>I am good at engaging in smaller sized groups or one-on-one, but can be uncomfortable speaking out in larger groups. I enjoy problem solving and learning new concepts/ideas.</p>
