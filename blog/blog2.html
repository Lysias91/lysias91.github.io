            <h1><u>My Learning Plan</u></h1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Long term goals and career pathway</h3>
            <p>I hope to obtain a job in the tech industry. I am not sure specifically what that looks like right now & am happy to keep my options open for the time being</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>I am good at engaging in smaller sized groups or one-on-one, but can be uncomfortable speaking out in larger groups. I enjoy problem solving and learning new concepts/ideas.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Non-technical skills Iâ€™d like to develop while at EDA</h3>
            <p>Ability to work collaboratively on complicated tasks with good communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Workload Management</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I plan to work during the day when others are at work and distractions are minimised. If I am unable to do this, I will make up the time in the evenings.</li>
                    <li>I have downloaded a pomodoro timer app that I will be using to ensure I am taking breaks.</li>
                    <li>When things are building up I will access my support network.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
            <p>I will reach out to my facilitator if I find I am at risk of becoming overwhelmed or if I am unable to solve my own problems</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Expectations of the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I expect the facilitators to be helpful, patient & supportive.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Commitments</h3>
            <p>I have minimised commitments for my time at EDA. I plan to continue socialising & volunteer work, but I will commit to these where I have capacity above my workload.</p>
