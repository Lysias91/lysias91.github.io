        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Long term goals and career pathway</h3>
            <p>I hope to obtain a job in the tech industry. I am not sure specifically what that looks like right now & am happy to keep my options open for the time being.<br> 
                I aim to gain enough skills & knowledge to enter the job market and be readily employable</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>I am good at engaging in smaller sized groups or one-on-one, but can be uncomfortable speaking out in larger groups. I enjoy problem solving and learning new concepts/ideas.<br> 
                I enjoy working with others & am receptive to the ideas/thoughts of others which I think will be beneficial during bootcamp.<br>
                I think my biggest non-technical challenges will be speaking in front of groups & staying on top of the material.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Non-technical skills Iâ€™d like to develop while at EDA</h3>
            <p>I'd like to work on my ability to explain complicated concepts clearly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Expectations of the bootcamp team</h3>
            <p>I expect the facilitators to be helpful, patient & supportive.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Expectations of myself</h3>
            <p>I will try my best to pull my weight in any group activities, I will ask if I do not understand something, & I will try to make the experice as enjoyable as possible for myself and those around me.</p>
